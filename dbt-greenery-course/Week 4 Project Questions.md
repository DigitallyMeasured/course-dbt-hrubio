Reflecting on my learning in this class...

    if your organization is thinking about using dbt, how would you pitch the value of dbt/analytics engineering to a decision maker at your organization?
    While dbt presents lots of benefits, i'd focus my pitch on reduced maintenance costs. With modularity, typical long SQL queries can be broken down & referenced, thus     allowing analysts to more easily understand what has been built and transition quicker into an engineer/analyst role. Bonus points for version control.
    
    if your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course?
    1. Go beyond the basic testing features of checking for uniques & null values. There's so much more to test, so this is untapped territory.
    2. Implement snapshots. This features opens the get for better master data management to keep track of key field changes overtime.
    
    
    if you are thinking about moving to analytics engineering, what skills have you picked that give you the most confidence in pursuing this next step?
    Personally I'd still avoid using the CLI. I understand there's way more control, but it's in a way another set of commands & steps to learn & maintain. I'll continue     using dbt cloud until i have no choice but to migrate.
    This course has allowed me to better appreciate the benefits of version control, specially in a team environment. I have a better understanding (and appreciation) of     documenting the changes through development and the availability of the fall back option to reverse to a prior state.
